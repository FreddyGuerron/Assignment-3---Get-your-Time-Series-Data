3. Data Collection Methodology. State how the data is collected, by whom, how often, etc. 
The U.S. Department of Transportation-Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) publishes the data, which is collected by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) through monthly surveys of fuel retailers and suppliers. It is released on a monthly basis to provide national average fuel price trends.

4. Why does this data set intrigue you?
As a current logistics analyst, this dataset intrigues me because fuel is one of the largest cost drivers in transportation. Monitoring monthly price trends helps me evaluate carrier costs, forecast shipping expenses, and make data-driven decisions on mode selection, route planning, and overall supply chain efficiency.
